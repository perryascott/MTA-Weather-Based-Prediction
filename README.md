# MTA Weather-Based Prediction

This repository contains code and data for predicting MTA ridership using weather data. The project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict ridership based on weather conditions.

Medium Article discussing some of the results and methodologies [here](https://medium.com/@perryascott2/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-commuters-weathers-impact-on-nyc-transit-91678e2a8198).

### TODO:
create predict_ridership.ipynb notebook
- Take a look at what



- Use residuals for certain weather metrics? (Only when temp diverges from norm by a lot)
