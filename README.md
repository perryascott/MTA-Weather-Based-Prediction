## TODO:

- [x] look at several other parameters from weather data
- [ ] pearson correlation and spearman correlation
- [ ] seperate out weekends and weekdays
- [ ] remove holidays (and surrounding days)
- [ ] consider looking at piecewise trends along weather axis
- [ ] piecewise of wind and discomfort index. look at piecewise!!
